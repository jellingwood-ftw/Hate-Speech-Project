# Example Game Configuration Spreadsheet
{:#intro .no_toc}

The example game configuration spreadsheet should be used as an example
to help contextualise the settings in the
[study configuration template spreadsheet](/link/StudyTemplate). It is the
study configuration spreadsheet that is used to generate the
[example game](/link/ExampleGame). This
spreadsheet is not always kept as up-to-date as the study configuration
spreadsheet, and therefore it should not be used as a basis to
create your own study (the study configuration template spreadsheet
should be used instead). More documentation on the spreadsheets can be
found in the [Study Configuration documentation](/StudyConfiguration).

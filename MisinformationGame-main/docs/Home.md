# The Misinformation Game
{:#intro}

The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
research participants. Participants will be shown one fake social
media post at a time, and they may then react to the post and its
comments. The Misinformation Game has been designed to be highly
customisable so that tightly controlled experiences can be created
for participants. This customisability is a core focus of The
Misinformation Game, to facilitate the research of a wide array of
social media related questions.

## Example Results

If you would like to view an example of the results that can be
gathered when using The Misinformation Game, the results of a user
experience study are available from
[the example results page](/link/ExampleResults).



## Getting Started
{:#getting-started}

The Misinformation Game contains many configuration options
to tailor the game for specific research purposes. To find
out whether The Misinformation Game is the right fit for
your research, we recommend that you read through the available
options for configuring your own study on the
[Study Configuration](/StudyConfiguration) page. Additionally,
the results that are made available for your analysis are
described on the [Results](/Results) page.

To conduct a study using The Misinformation Game, you will need
to host your own website for the game using Google Firebase.
The steps to host your own instance of the game are described in both a
[Non-Technical Installation Guide](/NonTechnicalInstallation)
and a [Technical Installation Guide](/TechnicalInstallation).
If you are proficient with the command-line and
installing technical tools, then the technical
installation guide will be quicker, and requires fewer
steps. However, if you are not familiar with these
technologies, then the non-technical installation
guide should be easier to follow.

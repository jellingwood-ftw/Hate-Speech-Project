# The Misinformation Game
The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
research participants. Participants will be shown one fake social
media post at a time, and they may then react to the post and its
comments. The Misinformation Game has been designed to be highly
customisable so that tightly controlled experiences can be created
for participants. This customisability is a core focus of The
Misinformation Game, to facilitate the research of a wide array of
social media related questions.
